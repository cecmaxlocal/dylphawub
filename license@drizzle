Drizzle, the now-discontinued open-source relational database management system forked from MySQL, is primarily licensed under versions 2 and 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Some components of Drizzle, including protocol drivers and replication messaging, are licensed under the BSD license. 

This dual licensing means:
- The core Drizzle database is covered by GPLv2 or GPLv3, which mandates that any derivative works also be open source under similar terms.
- Portions like client libraries and protocol-related code may be used more permissively under the BSD license, allowing broader reuse without strict copyleft requirements.

In summary, Drizzle’s licensing combines GPL for the main database system with BSD for some components, reflecting a balance between strong copyleft and permissive open-source licenses.[1][2][3][7]

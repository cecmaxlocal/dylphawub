The term "CEC license" can relate to different contexts depending on the domain, but commonly it refers to licensing related to:

1. **HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) Protocol**:  
   - The HDMI CEC protocol, which allows HDMI devices to control each other, often uses software and libraries licensed under open-source licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or BSD licenses.  
   - For example, open-source CEC related software like libCEC is dual licensed under GPLv2 and commercial licenses, enabling free use in personal projects and licensed use in larger-scale commercial applications.[1][3][4]

2. **California Energy Commission (CEC)**:  
   - In the context of energy and distributed resources, CEC licenses may refer to certifications or licenses related to energy devices or software compliant with California regulations. These may involve open-source software projects dedicated to smart grid and distributed energy resource communications, often under permissive open-source licenses promoting interoperability.[2]

So, the specific “CEC license” depends on your precise domain of interest:

- For **HDMI CEC protocol software**, expect common open-source licenses like GPLv2 or BSD.  
- For **California Energy Commission projects or software**, licenses tend to be open source, promoting wide usage and compliance.

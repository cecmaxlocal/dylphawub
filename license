Open source licenses are legal agreements that allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared under defined conditions. They generally fall into two main categories:

### Copyleft Licenses
- Require that any derivative works or modifications be distributed under the same license terms, thus preserving the openness.
- Common examples: GNU General Public License (GPL), Affero GPL (AGPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL).
- Ensure that source code and freedoms remain available to all users.
- Often considered "restrictive" because they impose sharing requirements on redistributed versions.

### Permissive Licenses
- Impose minimal restrictions on how the software can be used, modified, or redistributed.
- Allow incorporation into proprietary software without mandatory disclosure of source code.
- Common examples: MIT License, BSD License, Apache License 2.0.
- Typically preferred for maximum adoption due to their flexibility and simplicity.

### Purpose of Open Source Licenses
- To promote collaboration and sharing within the software community.
- To define what users can and cannot do with the software.
- To protect authors and users legally, including handling liability and patent rights.

### Popular Open Source Licenses

Open source licenses are fundamental to the free software ecosystem, providing a legal framework that balances openness, collaboration, and intellectual property rights.[1][2][3][8]

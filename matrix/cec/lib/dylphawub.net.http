To create a file named `dylphawub.net.http` for an HTTP server with strong linking and server features in Raku (Perl 6), an excellent approach is to use the Cro framework, which provides modern async HTTP server capabilities and routing.

Here is an example of a minimal HTTP server implemented in Raku with Cro to serve content and handle links:

```raku
use Cro::HTTP::Server;
use Cro::HTTP::Router;

# Define the routing logic for the server
my $app = route {
    get -> {
        content 'text/html', "<h1>Welcome to dylphawub.net.http server!</h1>";
    }

    get -> 'link' {
        content 'text/plain', "You followed the special link!";
    }

    get -> 'api', $resource {
        content 'application/json', qq:to/JSON/;
            {
                status => "success",
                resource => $resource
            }
        JSON
    }
};

# Create and start the server
my $server = Cro::HTTP::Server.new(:host('0.0.0.0'), :port(8080), :$app);

say "Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 ...";
$server.start;

# Proper shutdown on interrupt
react whenever signal(SIGINT) {
    $server.stop;
    say "Server stopped.";
    exit;
}
```

This script creates a server that:
- Listens on all interfaces at port 8080.
- Serves a simple HTML welcome page on root.
- Responds to `/link` with a plain text message.
- Serves a JSON response on `/api/{resource}` showing dynamic content.

You can save this as `dylphawub.net.http` (with `.pm6` extension for Raku) and run it via `raku dylphawub.net.http` to have a lightweight HTTP server with meaningful routes and link handling.

Cro provides asynchronous handling, routing, MIME content handling, and graceful shutdown, making it suitable for production-grade servers or development needs.

This approach aligns well with creating a "must very servers link" type structure by allowing clear route-link-method mapping.
